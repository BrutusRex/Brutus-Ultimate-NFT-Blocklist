# Brutus' Ultimate NFT Blocklist
A massive Twitter blocklist for mass-blocking NFT-related accounts.

The current largest NFT Twitter blocklist! This is a solo-made project. All major NFT pages and their followings are targeted. This blocklist also includes corporate accounts, brands, and celebrities who have supported NFTs and/or made their own NFTs (this includes Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, T-Pain, Crazy Frog, Gummibar, Pepsi, McDonald's, etc.). I hope that it meets your standards and that it will improve your time spent on Twitter. :)

This is preferably done on a computer - but in theory, it may also be able to be done on mobile.

If you are following an account (or vice versa) on the blocklist and you don't want to block them, the settings on Red Block can be changed to skip people you follow/who follow you (this is the default). Your mutual status with Crazy Frog should be safe.

If you're having trouble figuring something out, don't hesitate to ask me for help!

### My target blocklist size goal is 125k. We are currently at 4,882. Just about 120k left to go!

## How to use:

1. Unzip the .csv blocklist file. Then, download & install the Red Block extension for Chromium/Firefox.

For Chromium Browsers: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/red-block/knjpopecjigkkaddmoahjcfpbgedkibf/

For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/red-block/

2. After installing, click on the extension's button on the top right of your browser, and sign into Twitter if you are not already. Red Block is only a script tool, so it will not harm your account or access your personal information.

3. Click on the button that looks like a bullet list (it will say Blocklist Import/Export when you hover your cursor over it).

4. Click on Select Files, and then browse to where you have saved the blocklist file. 

6. Configure your desired settings, and then click the big red "Run Chain Block" button on the bottom of the Red Block UI. Keep Twitter open and let Red Block take care of the rest.

And that's it! Now you are much less likely to encounter any Cryptobros in the wild~ â™¥

Keep in mind that Red Block does not like to block more than 500 people at once to help protect your account from Twitter's anti-bot measures. You will likely need to click the reset button a few times and run the tool a few times.

## Do you believe that your account has been added to this blocklist by mistake? 
Accidents may sometimes happen; the process is not perfect, as the blocking is done through an automated script. If you think this is the case, contact me:
